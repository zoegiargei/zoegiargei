- 👋 Hi! My name is Zoe, I'm 23 years old, and I'm a full-stack developer with a proactive attitude. I studied in academies, and I'm also mainly self-taught. I get along very well with research and documentation.
  
- 👀 I believe I have great potential in the logical realm of thinking, and I can see how this contributes to my field.
  
- 🌱 Currently, I am working on multiple web projects, developing landing pages and web servers using technologies such as React, Zustand, Astro, Typescript, PHP, and MySQL. Additionally, I am responsible for the backlog, deciding which tasks are to be done and assigning them to team members.
  
- 💞️ I have a personal project that is not related to the software world, but entrepreneurship is giving me a lot of attitude towards productivity and progressing with the resources available.

- 🚀 The technologies in which I excel are: Typescript, React, Redux, Zustand, Astro, Next.js, Node.js, Express.js, Nest.js, Docker, and MongoDB.
